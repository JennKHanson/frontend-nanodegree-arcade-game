## Description

The Arcade Game is a Udacity project as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
Functionality for this game was implemented by using object-oriented JavaScript.

* Project Rubric
https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view

## How to Play
* The object of the game is to move the character to the water without being hit by a bug.
* The character is moved with keyboard arrow keys.
** Please note, the game can not yet be played on mobile devices. **
* If the character gets hit by a bug, the character moves back to the starting position.
* The game is over once the character reaches the water without being hit by a bug.

* Rodrick Bloomfield's walk-through was key to getting started with the project. I used his idea of
using classes instead of prototypes.

Sachin helped me figure out why I was getting a classList error. I needed to move the scripts to the
bottom of the page because displayModal was being called before the DOM was fully loaded.
